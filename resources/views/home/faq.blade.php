                        We don't allow reviewers to delete their reviews, but we do allow them to update their review.
                        We allow reviews to be updated if:
                        A substantial amount of additional work has been completed, or
                        The trajectory of the partnership has changed following the original reviewâ€™s publication
                        Reach out the Theytrustus representative who conducted the initial review. If you no longer know
                        the best point of contact, please reach out to reviews@Theytrustus.co.
                        We will schedule a call or send our Updated Review Form to collect feedback on your experience
                        with the vendor, including information regarding an updated scope of work or updated results and
                        feedback.
                        No original review content, including the quote, will be changed or removed from Theytrustus.co.
                        The original content will be listed at the bottom of the more recent review.

                        Data from public and third-party sources are incorporated into the TheyTrustUs Recommendability
                        Rating. When making a purchase decision, it shouldn't be treated as the only source of
                        information. Combined with other sources of information on a service provider's credibility,
                        such as client reviews and testimonials, endorsements from industry leaders, and peer
                        recommendations, the TheyTrustUs Recommendability Rating is designed to provide a reliable
                        assessment of a service provider's quality.

                        outsourcing different services and software solutions. Users can browse the categories with
